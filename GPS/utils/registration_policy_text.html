<b>gmax</b> Registration Policy</font>
<br><br>
The following text describes the <b>gmax</b> (free version) registration process and Discreet's policy on <b>gmax</b> registration information.
<br><br>
<b>gmax</b> (free version) requires on-line web registration using IE5.0 or greater before it can be used.
<br><br>
There is currently no support for registering <b>gmax</b> (free version) on machines that cannot browse the web via IE 5.0 or greater.   
<br><br>
New <b>gmax</b> users must visit <a href="http://www.discreet.com/products/gmax/register" target="_text">www.discreet.com/products/gmax/register</a> using each machine from which they intend to run <b>gmax</b>, and complete the on-line web registration process.
<br><br>
Registration of <b>gmax</b> on multiple PCs for a single user can be accomplished using the registration password that is automatically emailed to a new <b>gmax</b> registrant after their initial <b>gmax</b> on-line web registration.  Entering the identical email address and the e-mailed <b>gmax</b> password on the <b>gmax</b> registration web form during successive installations will generate a valid registration that is identical on all machines. A valid e-mail address is required during initial registration to ensure receipt of the password and to register multiple installations of <b>gmax</b> per user.
<br><br>
During <b>gmax</b> on-line web registration, as with many web sites that utilize login or registration information, a browser "cookie" is written by Discreet's servers onto each user's PC, containing basic <b>gmax</b> registration information.  Afterwards, during normal use, <b>gmax</b> reads from the browser cookie at launch to determine registration status.  Proper registration information in the browser cookie allows <b>gmax</b> to run without delay.
<br><br>
Because <b>gmax</b> relies on browser cookies for initial registration, "cookie cleanup" (deletion of browser cookies by a user) will affect <b>gmax</b> operation.  If a user removes <b>gmax</b> registration browser cookies after a valid on-line web registration session, <b>gmax</b> will continue to operate, but it will post a passive notice each time it is launched, reminding the user that their registration is incomplete.  <b>gmax</b> will continue to run normally in this case.    To repair an incomplete registration, <b>gmax</b> on-line web registration provides for easy recovery: by using the <b>gmax</b> registration password sent to each new <b>gmax</b> registrant's e-mail address during initial <b>gmax</b> on-line web registration, a <b>gmax</b> user can quickly regenerate a valid browser cookie on any internet-connected machine (as described above for multiple PC registrations). 
<br><br>
Discreet collects <b>gmax</b> registration data for statistical use and to help facilitate <b>gmax</b> user services and future product developments.  <b>gmax</b> registration data is a vital part of Discreet's ability to offer <b>gmax</b> to consumers for no charge.  Discreet respects <b>gmax</b> user privacy and individual preferences for the use of <b>gmax</b> registration data.
